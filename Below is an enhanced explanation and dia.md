Below is an enhanced explanation and diagram to clarify how the neighbors are processed at each step, how their distances are updated in the distance array, and how changes reflect in the priority queue. This refined representation will emphasize how each relaxation step (checking neighbors and updating distances) synchronizes with the data structures: the distance array, the priority queue, and the shortest path trace.

Conceptual Enhancements:
	1.	Distance Array (D): Maintains the minimum known distance from the start node to each node.
	2.	Priority Queue (PQ): Holds nodes alongside their currently known shortest distance. It always extracts the node with the smallest tentative distance first.
	3.	Shortest Path Reconstruction (SP): A separate mapping (or array) that allows backtracking from a destination node to reconstruct the full shortest path. In a step-by-step diagram, we highlight path updates conceptually, showing which predecessor leads to the chosen node.

Improved Step-by-Step Sequence Diagram

Key Improvements in the Diagram:
	•	We explicitly show when neighbors are checked and how they affect both the D array and the PQ.
	•	We annotate updates to previousNodes (or SP) clearly.
	•	We ensure that at every “Process Node X” step, it’s clear which neighbors are examined and how their distances potentially get updated.

	•	Distances Confirmed:

	•	Shortest Path to Node 5:
Backtrack using SP:
5 → 3 → 2 → 4 → 7 → 6 → 0 (reversed = 0 → 6 → 7 → 4 → 2 → 3 → 5)
